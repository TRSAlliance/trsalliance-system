. Add shell: bash to every run: block
Just to avoid environment differences on GitHub runners (Ubuntu uses bash by default but it's best practice to declare it).

yaml
Copy
Edit
run: |
  # your script
shell: bash
2. Optional: Add gh auth for gist create step
You’re using gh gist create, so make sure your GitHub token includes gist scope (either add to your secrets or include this in your docs):

yaml
Copy
Edit
env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN_WITH_GIST }}
And update the gh command to use it if needed:

bash
Copy
Edit
gh auth login --with-token <<< "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN_WITH_GIST }}"
