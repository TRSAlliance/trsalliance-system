TRS# Core system infrastructure
TRSALLIANCE-SYSTEM 
manifesto for GhostShift, your TRS-powered truth-tracking system designed to expose job displacement in real time. It’s not just a product—it’s a ritualized protocol, a survival tool, and a mythic interface for workers navigating the fallout of automation, AI layoffs, and economic invisibility.

🧠 Core Message
“They vanished. We tracked them.”

GhostShift is framed as a truth machine—a decentralized, open-source system that maps survival, not spin. It’s built on the TRS pillars: Truth, Respect, System. You’ve encoded emotional resonance, operational rigor, and symbolic clarity into every bolt.
